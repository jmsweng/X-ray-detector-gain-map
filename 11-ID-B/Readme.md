# Gain maps collected at 11-ID-B
Measurement conditions:
  - Scatterer: 8 glass microscope slides
  - Energy: 58.6 keV 
  - Exposure time: 3 minutes
  - Sample to detector distance: 1000 mm
  - Standard: CeO2

Radial averages with detector moved to several different positions without gain correction

Radial averages shown are normalized such that the max intensity is 1

Gain maps are provided as 32 bit .tif files that should be multiplied or divided by detector output (files have either mult or div in their name).
